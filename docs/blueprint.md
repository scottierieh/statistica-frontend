# **App Name**: Statistica

## Core Features:

- Data Upload: Allow users to upload CSV or TXT files containing numerical data for analysis.
- Descriptive Statistics: Calculate and display basic descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, variance, min, max, and percentiles.
- Data Visualization: Generate basic charts and graphs like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and line graphs for the uploaded data. The tool may use reasoning to add important data-relevant chart labels, such as annotations for skew.
- Correlation Analysis: Compute and display the correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.
- Data Filtering: Allow users to filter the data based on specified criteria to focus on particular subsets.
- Summary Report Generation: Create a downloadable summary report (PDF/TXT) of the calculated statistics and visualizations. The tool may use reasoning to select an appropriate organization.
- Clear Data: Clear all data that the user has inputted and reset to defaults.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) for a sense of clarity and intelligence.
- Background color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF), a desaturated variation of the primary color, to provide a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for interactive elements and highlights, to draw user attention without overwhelming.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, to create a modern, readable experience.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent statistical concepts and actions.
- Maintain a clean, organized layout with clear separation of data input, analysis, and visualization sections.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance user interactions, such as loading animations for data processing.
